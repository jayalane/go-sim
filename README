go-sim
======

Starting a modular simulation library for networked services. There is
a configuration to specify the network and the characteristics of the
various nodes (queue size, self-time latency distribution, failure
distribution, etc.), and the distribution to be used for input load.

The links between nodes will be channels, and the elapsing of time
will be marked by editing the stuff passed thru the channels.
